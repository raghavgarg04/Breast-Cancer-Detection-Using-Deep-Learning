# Breast Cancer Detector
 Developed a Breast Cancer Detector using deep learning models and an MRI dataset. The project involved training four different models: a Custom CNN, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and Inception Net. These models were trained to classify MRI images for the presence of breast cancer. To make the models accessible and interactive, I utilized the Streamlit library, which allowed me to create a user-friendly web interface to run the models on a local host. This setup enables users to upload MRI images and receive predictions from each of the trained models in real-time, facilitating an easy-to-use tool for breast cancer detection.
